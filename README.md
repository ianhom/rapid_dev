Rapid elite是基于stm32f103设计的开发板。开发板设计的方向主要面向网络通信和工业通信。由于单片机片上资源比较有限，rapid elite开发板专门针对这种情况开发了一套超小型版的Javascript引擎，不仅满足在资源有限的条件下运行，同时降低了硬件开发难度。

Rapid Elite is running on stm32f103 MCU. The design is basically focused on Internet and industrial communications. Due to the limitation of the MCU on-chip resources, the Javascript engine is shrinked to take up 40kb flash and 20kb RAM. However, the embedded application design becomes even easier than the other ways.
